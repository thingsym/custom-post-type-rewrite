# Introducing Custom Post Type Rewrite

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thingsym/custom-post-type-rewrite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thingsym/custom-post-type-rewrite)

This WordPress plugin adds default custom post type permalinks.

## Add permalink structure of custom post type

By default, there are no some permalinks of custom post type. The Custom Post Type Rewrite plugin adds permalink structure of custom post type. Following:

* date-based
* author-based
* front

## How do I use it?

1. Download and unzip files. Or install Custom Post Type Rewrite plugin using the WordPress plugin installer. In that case, skip 2.
2. Upload "custom-post-type-rewrite" to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Save permalink structure and refresh permalinks through the 'Settings > Permalinks' menu in WordPress.
5. Have fun!

**IMPORTANT**: By default, WordPress will not work the Custom Post Type Rewrite. You need to refresh permalinks.
